<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Fondue cheese is said to have originated on Alpine farms as a way to feed a family inexpensively; the original version was simply stale bread dipped in melted Gruyère. Swiss fondue became so popular that it was named the national dish of Switzerland in the 1930s. Now, this concoction of melted cheese is a decadent way to celebrate chilly winter nights. It features melted Gruyère along with other Swiss cheese; Emmentaler, Vacherin Fribourgeois, Appenzeller, and Raclette are blended in, depending on the region and personal preferences. Splashes of kirsch and wine and a bit of garlic are the traditional seasonings, but you can add a few chopped herbs, a swirl of mustard, or a spoonful of toasted spices if you like.</p>
<p>Eat the cheese by dipping accompaniments like cubed bread, cooked potatoes, sliced apples, pears, cornichons, pickled pearl onions, and salami into the pot. Be careful when dipping: The person who loses their garnish in the pot usually has to pay a penalty to the rest of the people at the table, like buy a round of drinks or clean up after the meal. After you eat the melted fondue cheese, the layer at the bottom of the pot cooks into a crust called a religieuse, a reward for the table eaten at the end of the meal.</p>
